 all_blogs &all_blog1 : dictionary variable
 blog_id :store id og each blog
 blog_add : name of url for adding form
 any_name : name of the urls of detais function

 models.py is not case sensitive

 consider that we have made many app and there r funtion with same name in different app so which app will be call when we call the function 
 so to deal with that ambiguity namespacing the url is do

 is_valid on checking whether data is valid put the valid data in cleaned_data  

 {{ form.as_p }} will render them wrapped in <p> tags
